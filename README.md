[//]: # (The directory machine-checked-proofs contains proofs of security properties, real-or-random secrecy of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, and authentication of the Station-to-Station protocol, and are written in Coq.)

### Prerequisites

To compile the files, you will need to have installed Coq on your local machine.

### Installing

To download and install Coq on your machine, follow the link [install coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download) here.

### Compile the Proofs

The directory machine-checked-proofs already has **Makefile** in it.

In order to compile all the files, use the command **make**.

To compile a single file _file.v_, you could use **coqc** command. For example, coqc _file.v_.

To generate a new Makefile by typing

  **coq_makefile -install none -I . *.v -o Makefile**

HTML Coqdoc files can be generated by

**coqdoc --html --toc --coqlib http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/ -d _dirname_ *.v**
