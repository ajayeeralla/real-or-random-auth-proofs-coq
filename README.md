[//]: # (The directory machine-checked-proofs contains proofs of security properties, real-or-random secrecy of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, and authentication of the Station-to-Station protocol, and are written in Coq.)
**Note:** exa_b.v represents an Example a.b in the paper

### Prerequisites

* To compile the files, you will need to have installed Coq on your local machine

### Installing

* To download and install Coq on your machine, follow the link [install coq](https://coq.inria.fr/download) here

### Compile the proofs

* The directory machine-checked-proofs contains a **Makefile**

* Type **make** to compile the files
  - It took about **15 mins** to compile all the files on the **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** system with **Intel Core i5 3.20 GHz** processor and **8GiB RAM**

* To compile a single file _file.v_, you could use **coqc** command. For example, coqc _file.v_

* To generate a new Makefile by typing

  - coq_makefile -install none -I . *.v -o Makefile**

* HTML Coqdoc files can be generated by
  **coqdoc --html --toc --coqlib http://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/ -d _dirname_ *.v**

* The directory webpages/coqdoc contains all the html files of the corresponding .v files
